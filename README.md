# Linear-Co-factor-Convolution
In MIPS

In this project I am implementing  floating point vector Linear Co-factor Convolution function (LCC) as given below.  
If A = [x1, y1, z1] and B = [x2, y2, z2], then 𝑪= LCC (𝑨, 𝑩) is defined as, C = [x3,  y3,  z3], where 
x3 =  (y1*z2 – y2*z1) 
y3 = -(x1*z2 – x2*z1) 
z3 =  (x1*y2 – x2*y1)
